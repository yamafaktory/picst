## ü§î What?

`picst` is a small CLI tool aiming at making the "copy ‚û°Ô∏è resize ‚û°Ô∏è paste" image workflow super simple and more friendly.

Start `picst`, copy an image, eventually provide new dimensions if not passed via the flags, paste it anywhere - a piece of cake!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Cargo

```sh
cargo install picst
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

With `height` and `width` dimensions (will be used until the process is stopped):

```sh
picst --height 300 --width 300
```

With no flags, dimensions will get prompted for every new image:

```sh
picst
```

Note: `picst` will keep running and checking for new images copied in the clipboard until the process is stopped.
